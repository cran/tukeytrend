  abstract = {Toxicity studies with drugs in animals are performed to establish
	the toxicity profile including the no-toxic-effect-level in the animals.
	One of the responses used in the search for effects is organ weight.
	Since organ weight is related to body weight of the animal, the analysis
	of organ weight has to be adjusted. A traditional analysis of covariance
	with body weight as covariate is not always appropriate since the
	body weight itself can be affected by the test compound. Hence, a
	multivariate analysis of variance is suggested, where the correlation
	between organ weight and body weight is taken into account in testing
	an overall treatment effect. Two dimensional plots of the contour
	curves are used to visualize the treatment effect on organ weight
	and body weight simultaneously. The test procedure suggested for
	comparing differences between control and treated groups of animals
	is: start by testing hypotheses of equality of covariance matrices
	for the different treatment groups and then, depending on the results
	from the first test, test equality of the mean vectors. (C) 1999

	and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple
	significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected
	proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses - the false discovery rate.
	This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are
	true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control
	of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired,
	there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type
	procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent
	test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power
	is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness
	of the criterion are illustrated with examples.}},

	If however the fetus survives the entire gestation period, growth
	reduction such as low birth weight may occur, or can exhibit a malformation.
	Ideally, a model should take the complete hierarchical structure
	of the data into account. So far, however, one has tackled the challenges
	in this setting only partly each time making different restricting
	assumptions (e.g., restriction to viable fetuses only). In addition,
	because of genetic similarity and the same treatment conditions,
	offsprings of the same mother behave more alike than those of another
	mother. Thus, responses on different fetuses within a cluster are
	likely to be correlated. The ultimate scientific question requires
	assessing the full effect of dose administration, not only in the
	malformation and weight outcome, but also in the death outcome. A
	hierarchical Bayesian method is proposed to this effect. Such a model
	can serve as a basis for quantitative risk assessment. (c) 2005 Elsevier

  abstract = {In a dose-finding study with an active control, several doses of a
	new drug are compared with an established drug (the so-called active
	control). One goal of such studies is to characterize the dose-response
	relationship and to find the smallest target dose concentration d(*),
	which leads to the same efficacy as the active control. For this
	purpose, the intersection point of the mean dose-response function
	with the expected efficacy of the active control has to be estimated.
	The focus of this paper is a cubic spline-based method for deriving
	an estimator of the target dose without assuming a specific dose-response
	function. Furthermore, the construction of a spline-based bootstrap
	CI is described. Estimator and CI are compared with other flexible
	and parametric methods such as linear spline interpolation as well
	as maximum likelihood regression in simulation studies motivated
	by a real clinical trial. Also, design considerations for the cubic
	spline approach with focus on bias minimization are presented. Although
	the spline-based point estimator can be biased, designs can be chosen
	to minimize and reasonably limit the maximum absolute bias. Furthermore,
	the coverage probability of the cubic spline approach is satisfactory,
	especially for bias minimal designs. (c) 2014 The Authors. Statistics

	experimental conditions is a routine research question addressed
	in biology. In order to assess differences statistically, multiple
	comparison procedures are applied. The most prominent procedures
	of this type, the Dunnett and Tukey-Kramer test, control the probability
	of reporting at least one false positive result when the data are
	normally distributed and when the sample sizes and variances do not
	differ between groups. All three assumptions are non-realistic in
	biological research and any violation leads to an increased number
	of reported false positive results. Based on a general statistical
	framework for simultaneous inference and robust covariance estimators
	we propose a new statistical multiple comparison procedure for assessing
	multiple means. In contrast to the Dunnett or Tukey-Kramer tests,
	no assumptions regarding the distribution, sample sizes or variance
	homogeneity are necessary. The performance of the new procedure is
	assessed by means of its familywise error rate and power under different
	distributions. The practical merits are demonstrated by a reanalysis
	of fatty acid phenotypes of the bacterium Bacillus simplex from the
	"Evolution Canyons" I and II in Israel. The simulation results show
	that even under severely varying variances, the procedure controls
	the number of false positive findings very well. Thus, the here presented
	procedure works well under biologically realistic scenarios of unbalanced
	group sizes, non-normality and heteroscedasticity.},

	scores maximises the power. Commonly, the underlying genetic model,
	i.e. additive, dominant or recessive mode of inheritance, is a priori
	unknown. Association studies are commonly analysed using permutation
	tests, where both inference and identification of the underlying
	mode of inheritance are important. Especially interesting are tests
	for case-control studies, defined by a maximum over a series of standardised

	models. We reformulate the test problem and propose a conditional
	maximum test of scores-specific linear-by-linear association tests.

	expectation and covariance can be derived in a closed form and the

	trial earlier if the treatment effect at MaxED is extreme. Williams'
	test (1972) is applied to test whether the selected MaxED is significantly
	different from control for the single-stage design and the first-stage
	test of the two-stage design. The sample size calculation for each
	design is provided. Extensive simulations are carried out to illustrate
	the performances of the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {When identifying the minimum effective dose (MED) or the lowest observed
	adverse event level (LOAEL), researchers usually employ multiple
	comparison procedures (MCPs). The ones preferred are the Dunnett-type
	difference-to-placebo and ratio-to-control test. In this article,
	we will use a model selection criterion, namely the generalized order-restricted
	information criterion (GORIC). The GORIC can evaluate a set of hypotheses
	regarding the response means directly and simultaneously, where in
	this case in each hypothesis a different dose is hypothesized to
	be the MED or LOAEL. It takes different patterns of increasing response
	with increasing dose into account without pooling response means,
	whereas MCPs with order restrictions do. The GORIC chooses the best
	hypothesis of the set leading to the identification of the MED and,
	depending on the set, to a specific pattern of response means. We
	will show, by simulation, that the GORIC has advantages in identifying
	the MED or LOAEL, besides theoretical ones. Supplementary materials

  abstract = {The statistical methodology for the design and analysis of clinical
	Phase II dose-response studies, with related software implementation,
	is well developed for the case of a normally distributed, homoscedastic
	response considered for a single timepoint in parallel group study
	designs. In practice, however, binary, count, or time-to-event endpoints
	are encountered, typically measured repeatedly over time and sometimes
	in more complex settings like crossover study designs. In this paper,
	we develop an overarching methodology to perform efficient multiple
	comparisons and modeling for dose finding, under uncertainty about
	the dose-response shape, using general parametric models. The framework
	described here is quite broad and can be utilized in situations involving
	for example generalized nonlinear models, linear and nonlinear mixed
	effects models, Cox proportional hazards models, with the main restriction
	being that a univariate dose-response relationship is modeled, that
	is, both dose and response correspond to univariate measurements.
	In addition to the core framework, we also develop a general purpose
	methodology to fit dose-response data in a computationally and statistically
	efficient way. Several examples illustrate the breadth of applicability
	of the results. For the analyses, we developed the R add-on package
	DoseFinding, which provides a convenient interface to the general
	approach adopted here. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Sandwich covariance matrix estimators are a popular tool in applied
	regression modeling for performing inference that is robust to certain
	types of model misspecification. Suitable implementations are available
	in the R system for statistical computing for certain model fitting
	functions only ( in particular lm()), but not for other standard
	regression functions, such as glm(), nls(), or survreg(). Therefore,
	conceptual tools and their translation to computational tools in
	the package sandwich are discussed, enabling the computation of sandwich
	estimators in general parametric models. Object orientation can be
	achieved by providing a few extractor functions - most importantly
	for the empirical estimating functions - from which various types
	of sandwich estimators can be computed.},
